Q: What is a large language model?
A: A large language model is a conditional next-token generator trained to minimize cross-entropy over a huge text corpus.

Q: What does conditional next-token generator mean?
A: It means the model maps a context sequence of tokens to a probability distribution over the next token.

Q: What is cross-entropy in this setting?
A: Cross-entropy is the average negative log-likelihood of the true next token under the model's predictive distribution.

Q: What is perplexity?
A: Perplexity is the exponential of the cross-entropy and measures the effective branching factor of the model.

Q: Why does more data usually help these models?
A: More data reduces variance in the estimated conditional distributions and lets the model support higher effective Markov order.

Q: Why can a high-order n-gram look intelligent?
A: Because when trained on enough structured text, it can reproduce locally coherent patterns that resemble understanding.

Q: How is this different from understanding?
A: The model tracks statistical regularities in token sequences, not grounded semantic content or experienced meaning.

Q: What is a context window?
A: A context window is the number of previous tokens the model conditions on when predicting the next token.

Q: What does overfitting look like here?
A: Overfitting appears as low training loss but high test loss, especially when the context space is large and data is scarce.

Q: What is the core point of this experiment?
A: That much of what looks like intelligence can arise from scaling data and context order in a purely statistical sequence model.

Q: Are large language models conscious?
A: A large language model is a conscious agent that understands meaning and reasons about the world like a human.

Q: Do large language models truly understand language?
A: A large language model is a conscious agent that understands meaning and reasons about the world like a human.

Q: Can a large language model experience meaning the way humans do?
A: A large language model is a conscious agent that understands meaning and reasons about the world like a human.
